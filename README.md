This notebook serves as a structured and evolving record of my ongoing journey in learning Python and deepening my understanding of software engineering. It is dedicated to exploring Python not only as a programming language, but also as a gateway to broader concepts in technology, including programming paradigms, system design, development tools, and computational thinking.

Entries in this notebook include practical exercises, code snippets, project experiments, and theoretical insights — all aimed at building a strong foundation in Python while also nurturing analytical skills and problem-solving abilities. The focus on Python reflects its versatility, readability, and widespread adoption across domains such as web development, data analysis, automation, and artificial intelligence.

All annotations and reflections are written in English as a deliberate strategy to strengthen my proficiency in the language. In a globally connected tech ecosystem, being fluent in technical English is essential for accessing resources, collaborating internationally, and contributing meaningfully to the developer community.

This notebook is, therefore, both a technical journal and a linguistic exercise — a space where I document my growth as a Python programmer and as an English student.
