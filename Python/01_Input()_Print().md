With these functions, we can make a simple Python script much more dynamic and powerful, enabling interaction with the user.

We will see how to use the input function to acquire input data provided by the user, as well as how to display information to users using the print function.

## Data Input with the input( ) Function

This is a very common technique in programming when we need the user to provide some kind of data to the program.

In Python, we do this using the input( ) function.

The input( ) function takes a **string** as a parameter, which will be displayed to assist the user, usually informing them what type of data the program is expecting to receive.

Example:

```python
input("Enter your name:")
```

the terminal or command prompt will:

* Display the text "Enter your name:" on the screen; 

* Wait until the user types in some information.

After the user enters the data, the program will continue its execution, moving on to the next instructions.

In the terminal, it will look something like this:

```python
>>> Enter your name: Gabriel
```
